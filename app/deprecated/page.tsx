        I am aware that some elements of this website are deprecated.<br /><br />
        With the release of Satisfactory 1.0, many exciting new features have been introduced.<br />
        However, as I am currently in my final year of university and focusing on my graduation project, my available time is quite limited.<br />
        I appreciate your patience and understanding, and I will do my best to update the website as soon as possible.<br /><br />
        Thank you for your support.<br />
